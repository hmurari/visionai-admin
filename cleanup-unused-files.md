# Cleanup: Unused Files After Deal Management Refactor

## Files That Can Be Deleted

The following files are no longer needed after consolidating deal management into the main deals page:

### 1. Deal Assignment Tab Component
- **File**: `src/pages/admin-dashboard-tabs/deal-assignment-tab.tsx`
- **Reason**: Deal assignment functionality has been moved to the main deals page. Admins can now assign deals directly from the deal cards.

## Files to Check for Unused Code

### 1. Admin Dashboard Components
- **File**: `src/pages/admin-dashboard.tsx`
- **Action**: Check if all imports are still needed after removing the deal tabs
- **Specific Areas**: Look for unused mutations, queries, and state management code that was only used by the removed tabs

### 2. SearchWithResults Component
- **File**: `src/components/SearchWithResults.tsx` 
- **Action**: Verify this component is still being used since it was heavily used in the removed admin deal tab

## Commands to Clean Up

```bash
# Remove the deal assignment tab component
rm src/pages/admin-dashboard-tabs/deal-assignment-tab.tsx

# Optional: Check for any imports of the deleted component
grep -r "deal-assignment-tab" src/
grep -r "DealAssignmentTab" src/

# Check for unused imports in admin dashboard
# (This should be done manually by reviewing the file)
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Test the application** to ensure:
   - Admin users can access the deals page and see all deals
   - Admin users can filter deals by reseller
   - Admin users can assign unassigned deals to partners
   - Regular users can only see their own deals
   - Deal creation and editing works for both admin and regular users

2. **Check console for errors** related to missing imports or components

3. **Verify functionality**:
   - Admin dashboard loads without the removed tabs
   - Deals page works correctly for both admin and regular users
   - Assignment functionality works in the deal cards
   - Filtering and search functionality works
