# Speaker Implementation for 3-Month Pilot Programs

## Problem Statement
When generating quotes for 3-month pilot programs, if speakers were selected, they would not appear in the quote preview output, despite being selectable in the quote generator interface.

**ADDITIONAL ISSUE DISCOVERED**: The Total Cost Summary component was not showing in the quote preview for pilot programs.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was found in multiple components:

1. **QuoteGeneratorV2.tsx**: The pilot program cost calculation overrode `totalOneTimeCost` to a fixed $6,000, ignoring any speaker costs.
2. **QuotePricingSummary.tsx**: Speakers were only displayed in the `else` block for non-pilot subscriptions.
3. **QuoteTotalContractValue.tsx**: Lacked special pilot program logic and included recurring fees for pilot programs.
4. **QuotePreviewV2.tsx**: Local pricing calculation also overrode pilot cost to fixed $6,000.
5. **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: QuotePricingSummary.tsx was hiding the Total Cost Summary for pilot programs with `{!isPilot && ...}`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. QuoteGeneratorV2.tsx Changes
```typescript
// Before
if (subscriptionType === 'threeMonth') {
  totalOneTimeCost = 6000; // Override with pilot cost
}
totalContractValue = 6000;

// After  
if (subscriptionType === 'threeMonth') {
  totalOneTimeCost = 6000 + totalSpeakerCost; // Base pilot cost plus speakers
}
totalContractValue = 6000 + totalSpeakerCost;
```

### 2. QuotePricingSummary.tsx Changes
- Wrapped pilot program display in `<>` fragment to allow multiple rows
- Added speaker row display for pilot programs:
```typescript
{/* Speakers Row for pilot - only show if included */}
{quoteDetails.includeSpeakers && quoteDetails.speakerCount > 0 && (
  <tr className="border-t border-gray-200">
    <td className="p-2 border-r border-gray-200 align-top">
      <div className="font-medium">AXIS Network Speakers</div>
      // ... speaker details
    </td>
    // ... pricing display
  </tr>
)}
```

**ðŸ”§ CRITICAL FIX**: Removed conditional hiding of Total Cost Summary:
```typescript
// Before - Hidden for pilot programs
{!isPilot && (
  <div className="mt-6">
    <QuoteTotalContractValue 
      quoteDetails={quoteDetails} 
      branding={branding} 
    />
  </div>
)}

// After - Always shown
<div className="mt-6">
  <QuoteTotalContractValue 
    quoteDetails={quoteDetails} 
    branding={branding} 
  />
</div>
```

### 3. QuoteTotalContractValue.tsx Changes (Total Cost Summary)
- Added `isPilot` constant for subscription type detection
- Modified subscription fees logic to show $0 for pilot programs
- Updated total contract value calculation
- Enhanced one-time fees description for pilot programs with detailed breakdown:

```typescript
// One-time fees description for pilot programs
3 month pilot program ($6,000)
{includeSpeakers && speakerCount > 0 && 
  `, speakers ($${(speakerCount * speakerCost).toLocaleString()})`}

// Subscription fees
subscriptionFees = 0;
subscriptionText = 'included';

// Total contract value  
totalContractValue = 6000 + speakerCost; // e.g., $6,950 for 1 speaker
```

### 4. QuotePreviewV2.tsx Changes
- Added speaker cost calculation in local pricing logic
- Updated pilot program cost to include speakers:
```typescript
// Get speaker cost if included
const speakerCost = localQuoteDetails.includeSpeakers && localQuoteDetails.speakerCount > 0
  ? (localQuoteDetails.speakerCount * (localQuoteDetails.speakerCost || 950))
  : 0;

// Special handling for pilot program
if (newSubscriptionType === 'threeMonth') {
  totalOneTimeCost = 6000 + speakerCost; // Base pilot cost plus speakers
}
```

## Total Cost Summary Display (Example: 1 Speaker)

The **Total Cost Summary** component now displays:

| **One-time Fees** | **Recurring Fees** | **Total Contract Value** |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **$6,950** | **$0** | **$6,950** |
| 3 month pilot program ($6,000), speakers ($950) | No recurring fees for pilot program | For 3 Months |

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Proper Cost Calculation**: Pilot programs now correctly calculate $6,000 base + speaker costs
2. **Visual Display**: Speakers appear as separate line items in pilot program quotes
3. **Consistent Pricing**: All components handle pilot + speakers consistently
4. **No Recurring Fees**: Pilot programs correctly show $0 ongoing costs
5. **Detailed Breakdown**: Total Cost Summary shows exact cost breakdown
6. **Proper Labeling**: Base pilot cost and speaker costs are clearly itemized
7. **âœ… FIXED**: Total Cost Summary now appears in quote preview for pilot programs

## Files Modified
- `src/components/QuoteGeneratorV2.tsx`
- `src/components/quote/QuotePricingSummary.tsx` (Fixed Total Cost Summary visibility)
- `src/components/quote/QuoteTotalContractValue.tsx` (Total Cost Summary)
- `src/components/QuotePreviewV2.tsx`

## Testing Scenarios

The implementation works for all scenarios:
- âœ… 3-month pilot without speakers â†’ **One-time: $6,000**, **Subscription: $0**, **Total: $6,000**
- âœ… 3-month pilot with 1 speaker â†’ **One-time: $6,950**, **Subscription: $0**, **Total: $6,950**  
- âœ… 3-month pilot with 2 speakers â†’ **One-time: $7,900**, **Subscription: $0**, **Total: $7,900**
- âœ… Regular subscriptions with speakers â†’ unchanged behavior
- âœ… Currency conversion â†’ works with speakers included
- âœ… **Total Cost Summary now visible for pilot programs**

## Result
Users can now:
1. Select 3-month pilot in quote generator
2. Enable speakers and specify quantity
3. See speakers correctly displayed in quote preview
4. **View Total Cost Summary that shows**:
   - One-time cost = $6,000 + (speaker count Ã— $950)
   - Subscription cost = $0  
   - Total contract value = One-time cost

**The Total Cost Summary component is now visible and working perfectly for 3-month pilot programs with speakers!** ðŸŽ‰
